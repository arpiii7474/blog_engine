# Blogify
Developed a full-stack blog application using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack. Implemented key features such as user login/signup, blog creation, viewing, deletion, and commenting on others' blogs. Employed JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication for secure login functionality.

1) Implemented a seamless user experience where new users are required to sign up before gaining access to the publishing feature. After signing up, users can securely log in to the application.
